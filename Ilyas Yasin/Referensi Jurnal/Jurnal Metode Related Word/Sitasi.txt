An illustration might be to investigate if there is a relationship between perceived sophistication of a design and the amount of previous experience buying consumer products online—and, if so, what is that relationship? We introduce simple regression analysis, which explores the relationship between an interval-scale or ratio-scale variable and a second variable of any scale, although more often than not, the second variable is also an interval-scale or ratio-scale variable. Examples could be the two variables that are each measured on a Likert scale or the above-mentioned example of perceived design sophistication and previous experience buying online. We also introduce in this chapter the correlation between two variables. The correlation is a dimensionless measure of the linear relationship between two variables, indicating its strength and direction, while regression analysis provides a quantification of precisely how one variable changes value as the other variable changes value.

The determinants of knowledge and the externalities present in the innovation process were discussed with immediate policy influence. In particular, the presence and strength of the spillover of the pool of past knowledge has encouraged high subsidization of R&amp;D in the most developed countries. We survey the empirical literature on the spillover effect in the production of knowledge and implement a meta-analytic regression. We discover that the average spillover effect is less than but close to one and is highly significant. We also find that the spillover effect tends to be greater when the estimation of knowledge production accounts for foreign inputs, and it tends to be lower when the estimation includes only rich economies, regional data are used, and the pool of knowledge is not the patent stock.
